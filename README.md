<!About Me
I'm  undergraduate Computer Science student, I’ve discovered the fascinating world of data science, where coding meets creativity and analytics. From diving into Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy to visualizing insights with Matplotlib and Seaborn, I’ve been building the foundation to solve real-world problems using data. Whether it’s cleaning messy datasets, uncovering hidden trends, or creating predictive models, I’m passionate about turning raw data into meaningful stories. Every project is a step closer to mastering the art of data science, and I’m excited to keep learning, experimenting, and growing in this dynamic field! 🚀
